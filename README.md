# BudgetBuddy 📊💰  
**A Python-powered Personal Expense Analyzer**

---

## 📌 Overview

**BudgetBuddy** is a mini-project designed to take raw CSV expense data and transform it into a structured, insightful summary report. The output includes:

- Cleaned and categorized expense data  
- A JSON report with totals and statistical insights  
- A matplotlib visualization with a line of best fit  
- Custom-built algorithms for savings growth and expense trend analysis  

This project was created as a personal exercise to apply and reinforce Python programming and mathematical skills, particularly during breaks between coursework.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I'm currently taking several Computer Science and Math courses, including:

- MIT 6.0002 (Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science)
- UBCx: How to Code – Simple and Complex Data
- MIT 6.042J (Mathematics for Computer Science)
- MIT 6.006 (Introduction to Algorithms)
- AP Calculus (Previously completed)

This project gave me a chance to step away from theory and put my learning into practice by combining:

- **File Parsing & Input Handling** (`csv`, `json`)
- **Custom Class Structures & Modules**
- **Math Algorithms (Exponential Growth, Linear Regression)**
- **Data Visualization** using `matplotlib`
- **Saving JSON and Graphs to Files**

## 🧮 Key Features

- 📂 Reads and parses `.csv` files containing expenses
- 📊 Outputs a clean and readable `.json` report:
  - Total spending
  - Top categories
  - Linear regression analysis of your spending habits
  - Projected savings using exponential growth
- 📈 Saves a graph with a regression line
- 🧠 No external math or data libraries used for core calculations – just raw Python and logic!

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- `csv`, `json`, `os`, `collections`, `matplotlib`
- No `pandas`, `numpy`, or `scikit-learn` — All algorithms implemented manually

---

## 📁 Output Structure

- `output/`
  - `report.json`: A complete summary of the user's financial data
  - `expenses_plot.png`: A visual chart showing trends and regression
- `data/`
  - `expenses.csv`: Raw input file

## 🚀 What's Next

- I've completed all the concepts I wanted too, I will now
    continue my courses and deepen my CS/Math knowledge
    to build better projects in the future
